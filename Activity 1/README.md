1. Code up a \guess the number game". Pick a number between 0 and 99, and then
prompt the user to guess that number. If they guess too low, print to screen \sorry,
that's too low". If they're too high, print \oops, you're too high". When they guess
the correct number say \well done, you got it!". If they enter a number that is not
between 0 and 99, print a message saying \oops, invalid entry. Try again".
2. Write some code that will prompt the user to enter 5 numbers, calculate the mean of
those 5 numbers, and print it to screen.
3. Write some code that will calculate the Taylor series expansion of ex, using the rst N
terms. N must be provided by the user at the command line, as well as x. 
4. Write some code that will prompt the user to enter the coeffcients a, b and c for
a second-order polynomial, and then print the roots to screen. Test your code for
(a; b; c) = (3; 6; 2), which has roots -0.42 and -1.57.
5. Write some code that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if
it is a vowel, False otherwise.
6. Write some code that prompts the user to enter 3 numbers, and then prints the them
to screen in ascending order. What if a number is repeated? E.g. 6, 6, 2.
7. The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the suffix -s, which
is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs. A simple set of rules can be
given as follows:
 If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies
 If the verb ends in o, ch, s, sh, x or z, add es
 By default just add s
Your task in this exercise is to write some code which given a verb in infinitive form
returns its third person singular form. Test your function with words like try, brush,
run and fix.
8. Write some code that prompts the user to enter 3 integers representing the lengths
of the sides of a triangle. Your code must tell the user whether or not the triangle is
right angled.
9. Write some code that will prompt the user to enter a particular date in numerical
format. For example, they should enter 20/07/2013 for 20 July 2013. Your code
must then print to screen the day of the year corresponding to that date. For example,
03/03/2011 was the 62nd day of 2011, whereas 03/03/2012 was the 63rd day of 2012.
Your code must take into account leap years!
